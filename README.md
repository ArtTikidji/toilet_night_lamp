Imagine the situation, you are sleepy and going to the bathroom. And when the light comes on, you feel a "slight" discomfort. The project is designed to solve this problem by gradually increasing the brightness of the light source.

A feature has also been added to solve another problem related to automatic on/off lighting: In a situation where you walk into a bathroom where the light is already on, you don't know when it will turn off. This can happen at the most inopportune moment, or it can just scare you. To prevent this from happening, a motion check is done for 30 seconds before you turn it off. If motion is detected, the light will not turn off.
